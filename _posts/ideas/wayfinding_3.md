			<strong>The Magic Number 7 ± 2</strong>
			The original map shows they put some thought into mapping the blue trail and water.
			Unfortunately, they chose one of the most confusing solutions.
			Using two blues here is not a problem.  The map should simply match the blue used on the physical trail
			with the blue used on the map.  Then adjust the value darker or lighter (whichever will create more contrast)
			for the water.
		</li>

			<strong>Landmarks</strong>
			Putting the power lines on the map is ingenious.  One of the first times I went to Raven Run I got "lost"… it's
			really not that big, but I felt lost.  And I found my location by using the power lines as a landmark.
			These are gigantic power lines and are highly visible from any location near them as well as from other higher altitudes.

		<li>
			<strong>Know your user</strong>
			Gradients instead of elevation lines.  Chances are the people using these maps are not trained in reading elevation
			maps, however, gradients are very intuitive.
		</li>
		<li>
			Focus information to the minimum.  This means only include information relevant in accomplishing the users' tasks.
			You really can't discover them without performing a usability analysis, but I'm going to use my experience.
			I want to (a) follow a trail, (b) know where I am, (c) know how to get out. 
		</li>
		<li>
			I don't really need to see a defined park boundary, whatever is not included on the map I'm going to assume is not within
			the sanctuary.
		</li>
		<li>
			I need to know where the parking lot is.
