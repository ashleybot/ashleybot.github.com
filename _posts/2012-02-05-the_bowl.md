		I was recently reminded of this meditation from a wise soul.  It's rather beautiful.
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Thirty spokes unite at the single hub;
				<br />
				It is the empty space which makes the wheel useful.
				<br />
				Mold clay to form a bowl;
				<br />
				It is the empty space which makes the bowl useful.
				<br />
				Cut out windows and doors;
				<br />
				It is the empty space which makes the room useful.
			</p>
			<cite>Laozi, Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching</cite>
