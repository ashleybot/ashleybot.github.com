<p>According to Wikipedia, "most glassblowing is done between 1600 and 1900 Â°F."</p>
<p>In my undergrad days, I used to sneak above the glass studio and watch other students take advantage of the liquid property of glass and contort it into shapes using air and gravity.</p>
<p>I was afraid of it then. The thought of something of that temperature frightened me. It might has well of been the center of the earth.</p>
<p>Glass is dangerous. When it's hot, it can severely burn you. When cold, it can cut you. Around that time, I was unfortunate enough to have a glass vase shatter in my hands. It wasn't a traumatic event, but I'll just say it was quite complicated to have the shards removed.</p>

<h4>Glass was a foe to my existence.</h4>
<p>Until one day, I decided to face the fear and I signed up for an art workshop in Louisville. That weekend I learned much more than the techniques of making glass paperweights.</p>
<p>I learned that we should take risks even when we are afraid.</p>
<p>Something much more beautiful than what you could have ever imagined may result.</p>
