			Much of my time these days is spent reading articles on usability.  One of which is particularly pertinent to my <a href="/2012/02/15/d3-basics.html">recent post on charting</a> with D3.js.

			<h4> Simplicity == Understandability </h4>


			I believe most people are familiar with the notion that charts should be visually very simple.  It's widely known that the realism of 3-dimensional bars in a chart presents unnecessary cognitive demand.

			Excepting Excel, most programs and libraries (D3 being a great example) follow this principle by using 2-dimensional bars by default.

			Ah, BUT, and this is a good point that I'll return to in my writings, it is *highly* context-based.  Yes, friends, while the eliminate-chartjunk principle is true, it is not universal.

	<h4>Surprising Findings</h4>


	Some researchers found that in situations of high graphical literacy, additional dimensional data does not have a negative effect on interpretation of data.  Meaning, people who have learned how to read a chart are unaffected by a 3-dimensional bar.

	It's more complicated than that, but this is a very interesting finding considering we thought that "chartjunk" is a very bad thing in all situations.

	<h4> 2d > 3d > 1d </h4>


	Another fun tidbit of their findings is that, in a pairwise comparison, the increase of a dimension is as equally detrimental as the reduction of a dimension.  To summarize, use a bar that looks like a square rather than a single line or a cube.

	Context is extremely important.  Your data, what your reader has to interpret from that data, and the reader's experience are all in play, but, in general, follow the status-quo and make it simple.
