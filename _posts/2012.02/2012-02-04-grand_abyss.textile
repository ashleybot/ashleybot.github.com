		Yesterday, I lost my car key somewhere between 1.5 hours and 5 miles of forest.

		I was alone. I didn't have a cell phone.

		After my initial gut-wrench reaction, my thoughts went to which <strong>search algorithm</strong> I could employ to most efficiently retrace my steps and find my key.

		I knew I had the key about 1 mile into the beginning of the hike and I had three traversal options:
		<ol>
			<li>Start from the beginning</li>
			<li>From the end</li>
			<li>Use the many artery trails to subdivide the main trail</li>
		</ol>

		At this point, the avid reader is noticing an <strong>important detail</strong> which changes the entire story.

		<h5 class="subheader">There are other hikers on the trail.</h5>

	It didn't occur to me that other hikers might affect my search.

	In fact, I didn't realize this until my key was miraculously returned to me. The kind couple who gave me the key were given the key by another couple.

	I needed a packet routing algorithm all along!  Silly me.
