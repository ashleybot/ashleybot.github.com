				According to wikipedia, most glass blowing is done between 1600 and 1900 degrees Fahrenheit.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my undergrad days, I used to sneak above the glass studio and watch other students take advantage of the liquid property of glass and contort it into shapes using air and gravity.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was afraid of it then.  The thought of something of that temperature frightened me.  It might has well of been the center of the earth.
			</p>

				Glass is dangerous.  When it's hot, it can severely burn you.  When cold, it can cut you.  Around that time, I was unfortunate enough to have a glass vase shatter in my hands.  It wasn't a traumatic event, but I'll just say it was quite complicated to have the shards removed.

	<h4>
		Glass was a foe to my existence.
	</h4>
	<p>
		Until one day, I decided to face the fear and I signed up for an art workshop in Louisville.  That weekend I learned much more than the techniques of making glass paperweights.
	</p>
	<p>
		I learned that we should take risks even when we are afraid.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Something much more beautiful than what you could have ever imagined may result.
