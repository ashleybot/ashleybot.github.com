		A benefit of living in Kentucky is its beautiful <a href="http://parks.ky.gov/" target="_new">state parks</a>, federal forest preserves, and local parks and sanctuaries.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the local nature sanctuaries, <a href="http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?page=276" target="_new">Raven Run</a>, is only 15 miles outside of town.  It features several hiking trails over diverse terrain and views of the Kentucky River Palisades.  You can view the official map embedded in a pdf <a href="http://www.lexingtonky.gov/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=15670" target="_new">here</a>.

		Actually, don't follow that link, you can just view the screenshot I snipped.

		To be fair, the actual map that is provided at the sanctuary is slightly different, but they both have common problems related to cognition.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my next post, I'll make some suggestions based on my heuristic analysis.
