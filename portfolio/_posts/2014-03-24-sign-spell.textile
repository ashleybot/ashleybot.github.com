      Sign Spell was created during an independent study while completing my dual-masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction.

    <h4>Literature Review</h4>
    <p>
      I began the project with a review of recent research in sign language instructional design and learning sign language as a second language.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that there is a gap in learning solutions for hearing family members, and, most importantly, parents. 95% of deaf people have one or more hearing parents[1].
    </p>
    <p>
      There are products and college courses for interpreters, but these don't consider the stressors new parents face, or solutions for families as a whole.

    <h4>Non-digital Game Design</h4>
    <p>
      Creating a game first without the consideration of technology enables the designer to focus on quality game mechanics.
      It is easy to become overwhelmed by technical decisions and, sometimes, limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created a table-top card game, Sign Shift, to focus on game mechanics. In this game, I focused on replacing hand position and palm orientation with cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game requires preliminary knowledge of sign language. So, the next logical step in brainstorming a digital game was to incorporate a mechanic which allowed for learning new signs.

    <h4>Brainstorming</h4>

    <hr class="hide-for-small" />
    <p>
      After much brainstorming, I wanted to add more opportunities for fun dynamics in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sign Spell doesn't resemble non-digital version. The only likeness comes from the realization that hand signs can be successfully replaced with game elements like cards or controllers.

      I created a prototype using Node.js and Socket.io to quickly get to a point where I could playtest.

    <h4>Playtesting</h4>
    <p>
      I playtested the game in three rounds. My goals were to uncover any problems with the using an uncommon control mechanism, to analyze mechanics, and to improve the learning scaffold.

    The game uses the accelerometer in a smartphone. The player chooses a playing piece via swipe and activates the piece via a double shake.
