## {{ page.title }}

Chip the Scooter is a 3D Short experiment to showcase my skills in 3D modeling and animation.

I took a 3D Design course in Portugal. It was the first course I’ve ever taken based on a specific technology. In this case, using 3DS Max to create quality 3D models and animations.

I struggled at the beginning of the semester until I took it upon myself to follow tutorials online. At the end of the semester I became very efficient at making realistic models and animating characters. Basic knowledge and workflow tips are highly important in successful use of a tool.

For example, build your objects in real-world measurements and actually use real-world measurements.

I began by brainstorming about the object I wanted to build, then I researched images of the object from all angles. I used reseller sites like Etsy and Ebay to easily find images. In this example, I built an old office chair. I researched real-world dimensions of common office chairs.

I then began the model by creating a bounding box. It’s a mostly invisible box to keep the object’s size from creeping bigger.

I used basic polygons to create the major pieces of the chair. From there I applied polygon modifications to the edges to make it more realistic.

I used UVW unwrap to create a texture map and bump map for the chair’s texture. I used shaders for the reflective metal surfaces of the chair.
