## {{ page.title }}

Code Rummy is a card game offering new programmers a fun way to improve debugging skills and recognition of programming errors.

This game was created during an independent project in a Design of Educational Games course at Carnegie-Mellon University. The goal of this project was to gain experience in educational games design based on the MDA framework.

I began by brainstorming game ideas based on a cognitive task analysis of novice and expert programmers presented with a new programming language syntax.

I playtested the game during four sessions and analyzed the game play by looking for dynamics which would support the learning goals I had set. I incorporated two instructional design principles in designing the gameplay.

Instructional Design Principles
	⁃	IES #2 interleave worked solutions with problems :: Players create solutions for other players. When it is the player’s turn they are introduced with a problem to solve.
	⁃	IES #7 deeper understanding
	⁃	Players must think more creatively and strategically how to make more legal code statements rather than how to solve a problem. This can help them to be more creative when needing to solve a problem with code.
