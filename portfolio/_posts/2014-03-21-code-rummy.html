			This game was created during an independent project in a Design of Educational Games course at Carnegie-Mellon University. The goal of this project was to gain experience in educational games design based on the MDA framework.

			Instructional Design Principles
			<ul>
				<li>
					IES #2 interleave worked solutions with problems. Players create solutions for other players. When it is the playerâ€™s turn they are introduced with a problem to solve.
				</li>
				<li>
					IES #7 deeper understanding
				</li>
				<li>
					Players must think more creatively and strategically how to make more legal code statements rather than how to solve a problem. This can help them to be more creative when needing to solve a problem with code.
