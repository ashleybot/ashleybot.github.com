      This project was created for the final project of the Design of Educational Games course at Carnegie-Mellon University. I worked as part of a team of 4 students (2 graduate and 2 undergraduate). We brainstormed a game to teach students programming fundaments focusing on discovery learning.

    We wanted to separate the logic of fundamental concepts away from syntax. And we decided to focus on two important concepts: arrays and conditional statements. These learning objectives are tightly coupled into the gameplay. To succeed, the player must learn these concepts in order to play the game. He/she doesnâ€™t play the game with a layer of programming knowledge on top. James Gee found that learning where the student learns everything himself is much more effective.

    There are three levels to the game. The first and second encourage the player to fix a broken robot and in doing so, they learn to organize information conditionally. The third level is a whack-a-mole game based on an array with zero-based indexing.
